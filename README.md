Stock Ticker

Project Name
Stock Ticker

This stock ticker retrieves a list of stock price information from the interwebs and outputs each one.

* Stock tickers to be loaded can be changed in the "tickers.dat" file.
* The main configuration file is "stockticker.config".  This file contains all settings, such as the url to retrieve stock price information.

This program was originally intended to be used in conjuction with Raspberry Pi, which outputs the stock ticker to a scrolling LED.
A cron job runs the program at set time intervals when the stock market is open.
